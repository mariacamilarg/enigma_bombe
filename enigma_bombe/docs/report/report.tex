\begin{abstract}
	This is the work proposal to follow in the course Project as part of the master M1 in Computer Science and Communication Networks at Télécom SudParis. The goal is to implement the Enigma machine used in World War II, followed by the Bombe machine that breaks the cipher, created by Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman at Bletchley Park.

\section{Introduction}

The enigma machine is a cipher machine used by the Nazi Germany during World War II in order to send secret coded messages. It was initially a commercial machine bought by banks are businesses. But then the military took it and added an extra security layer called plugboard. It was innovative at the time because it was not a substitution cipher, i.e. the same letter can get different results after encryption. \\

The machine works by a combination of moving rotors and inside wiring as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:machine}. The way to use it is that when the sender types a message, a bulb lights up indicating the correspondent coded letter. Then, in order to decode, the receiver types the coded message he received and the initial message lights up on the board. In war times the coded messages were transmitted over morse code. \\

\end{figure}

In the military version of the Enigma Machine there were 5 possible rotors to pick from, each with 26 possible positions, then there were 10 possible switching in the plugboard that could choose a pair from the available 26 letters. That accounts for $158962555217826360000$ different combinations for
the setting of the army Enigma Machine \cite{numberphile1}. The initial setting for each day was given to the bases in a sheet of paper that had the monthly configurations of the machine. So they changed the setting everyday. \\

So in order to decipher the code, you needed either to have the code sheet or to break the message. This latter was what the scientists at Bletchley Park did; and what I will try to recreate in this project. 

\section{General Goal}

To understand the code breaking process behind the enigma cipher.


\section{Specific Goals}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To implement the Enigma machine with software
	\item To implement the Bombe machine that breaks the Enigma cipher
	\item To understand the mathematical and probabilistic techniques used to break a cipher with limited time and computational resources. 
	\item To understand the weaknesses exploited that allowed to break the Enigma cipher
\end{itemize}


\section{Implementation}

I implemented a project in Python that replicates both the Enigma Machine and the Bombe Machine. I explain in the following subsections the details of each of them.

\subsection{Enigma Machine}

There are different models of the Enigma machine that were developed through time. In this project I chose one of the latest, i.e. with more complicated settings. This is the model M3 \& M4 Naval (from Frebuary 1942) that has 8 possible rotors \cite{dade,wikirotors}.

\subsubsection{Challenges}

The biggest challenge in implementing the Enigma machine is knowing exactly how it worked. Even thought there is a great amount of information online, the depth of it is not that significant. Most of the resources tend to shallowly explain the behavior but there are several subtleties and details that were hard to find. I put in the references the most trustworthy and complete information I found on the matter \cite{rijmenants,sale,cryptomuseum,wiki,wikicryptanalysis,ellsbury}. \\

Another challenge was the translation of this information, because the original machine settings are in German. This implies that there are multiple acceptable translations for several parts of the machine that might be opposite among different sources. A concrete example of this goes within the rotor, where there are 2 different settings called \textit{Ringstellung} and \textit{Grundstellung}. They refer to the ring setting within each the rotor and to the ground setting or offset of the rotor within the machine, respectively. However figuring out which one was which presented a problem because different sources referred to them by different names, sometimes even opposite. So I had to solve this by recurring to the German words. \\

Finally, I would like to refer as well to different simulators that are found on the internet in which I could get a phenomenological understanding of the machine. I was able to try out different configurations and learning its way to function. I also confirmed my solution against these simulators in order to test my implementation. This was a positive match.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Enigma Exploits}

- A letter can never be encrypted to itself, so turing eliminated thousand of permutations
- some operators forget to change the settings each day, so that lowers the odds
- breakthrough: the daily weather forecast, everyday the atlantic weather is forecasted from the u boats and everyday it follows the same format (windspeed, atmospheric pressure and temperature), so it's the same message layout
- they created "cribs" an intelligent guess of part of the code
- there were typical messages as "weather for the night" "situation eastern channel" "beacons lit as ordered" etc
- with those typical messages we can scan the transmissions and locate where it is within the text (where no letter ciphers to itself)
- with all the possible positions we create a set of hypothesis called a menu, a diagram like fig x. from there, we need to fing a enigma configuration that corresponds to the menu. that was the role of the bombe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dKG21u2aSo





\section{Discussion}

- historic relevance
- not only breaking it, it needed strategy, not letting them know they cracked the code
